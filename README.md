# This script calculates voltage, current, or resistance using Ohm's Law.
# Ohm's Law states that V = I * R, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.  
current = float(input("Enter current (I) in Amperes: "))
resistance = float(input("Enter resistance (R) in Ohms: "))
voltage = current * resistance  
print(f"Voltage (V) is: {voltage} Volts")
Enter the current (I) in Amperes: 3
enter the resistance (R) in Ohms: 10
Voltage (V) is: 30.0 Volts
